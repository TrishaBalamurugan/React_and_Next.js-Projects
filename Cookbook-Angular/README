Cookbook Angular Project

Description:
This is a personal Angular project where I built a Cookbook app. Users can browse, search, and view recipes. The project helped me learn Angular components, services, routing, and data binding.

Setup Instructions:
1. Clone the repository
   git clone <your-repo-url>
2. Navigate to the project folder
   cd cookbook-angular
3. Install dependencies
   npm install
4. Run the development server
   ng serve
5. Open a browser and go to http://localhost:4200

Project Structure:
- src/           --> Contains all the source code (components, services, modules)
- assets/        --> Images, icons, and other static assets
- angular.json   --> Angular CLI configuration
- package.json   --> Project dependencies and scripts

Notes:
- This is a learning project; styling is basic and may not be fully responsive.
- node_modules/ and dist/ are excluded from this repository.
